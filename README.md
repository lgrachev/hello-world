# hello-world
My first repository

This is my first github account and I will post my projects here for you to view them as I'm growing as a programmer 
and an engineer. My initial projects will be hobbies and simple simulators to showcase my skills and abilities to 
employers. 

I am currently looking to get an entry level software development position in Boulder, CO or a nearby area.

Hope you enjoy my work, all criticism welcome!

Leo
